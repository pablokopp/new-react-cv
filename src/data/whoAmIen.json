    "text":"I am a Front End Dev looking for a company in which to contribute my unique characteristics to develop. I became interested in development a few years ago beginning to turn that interest into solid knowledge in 2020. I currently use HTML, CSS, Javascript, Git and ReactJs as my main work tools. Added to this is the use of component libraries (Material Ui, Semantic Ui), Firebase, Storybook, BEM nomenclature, Atom Design, SASS, among other technologies that help me thrive as a developer. Also I have a UX understanding so all my solutions have a user perspective. I am also a professional dancer and entertainer, which gives me a background of creativity, adaptability and communication to face new experiences and learnings."
